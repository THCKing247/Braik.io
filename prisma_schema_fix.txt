You need to make two changes to prisma/schema.prisma:

1. Add imageUrl field after notes (around line 206):
   Change:
     notes        String?  @db.Text
     uniqueCode   String?  @unique
   
   To:
     notes        String?  @db.Text
     imageUrl     String?  // Player profile image URL
     uniqueCode   String?  @unique

2. Add depthChartEntries relation after assignedInventory (around line 216):
   Change:
     assignedInventory InventoryItem[]
     
     @@index([teamId])
   
   To:
     assignedInventory InventoryItem[]
     depthChartEntries DepthChartEntry[]
     
     @@index([teamId])

Then run: npm run db:push
